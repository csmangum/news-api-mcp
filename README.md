# News API MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to global news articles through the [News API](https://newsapi.org/). This server implements a standardized interface for searching news articles, retrieving top headlines, and listing available news sources.

## Features

- Search for news articles on any topic with advanced filtering options
- Retrieve top headlines by country, category, or source
- Get information about available news sources with filtering by category, language, and country
- Built-in error handling and rate limit management

## Installation

### Using Claude Desktop

#### Installing via Docker

- Clone the repository and build a local image to be utilized by your Claude desktop client

```sh
cd news-api-mcp
docker build -t mcp/news-api .
```

- Configure your `claude_desktop_config.json` with your News API key:

> `claude_desktop_config.json` path
>
> - On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
> - On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual News API key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "newsapi": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "mcp/news-api"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEWS_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative: Using .env file with Docker**

If you prefer to use a `.env` file (see Environment Configuration section above), you can run the container manually:
```bash
docker run -i --rm --env-file .env mcp/news-api
```

#### Installing via Smithery

To install News API MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @berlinbra/news-api-mcp --client claude
```

### Development Setup

#### Install packages

```
uv install -e .
```

#### Environment Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```bash
# News API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://newsapi.org/
NEWS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

2. Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual News API key.

You can get a free API key from [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/).

#### Running

After connecting Claude client with the MCP tool via json file and installing the packages, Claude should see the server's mcp tools.

You can run the server yourself via:
```
uv run src/news_api_mcp/server.py
```

with inspector:
```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /Users/{INSERT_USER}/YOUR/PATH/TO/news-api-mcp run src/news_api_mcp/server.py
```
